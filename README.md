# Images Repo

This project is an image repository app built with Python using the Django framework. The App will allow the user to add images to the site from their computer and delete those images.

Due to initial time constraints the following aspects will need to be added in the future:
* Continuous Integration and Delivery
* Unit and Function tests

To further enhance and build upon this app other features that could be added include:
- ADD and DELETE images in bulk
- SEARCH function to filter images
- SELL/BUY images
